A simple VRChat shader avatar addon that dims bright areas of the screen.
It does not prevent strobing, though the Blackout option can help a lot in some circumstances.

VRCFury is required for simple installation.
GestureManager is recommended for easy testing.

Do not expect support; this is a free asset for my own use that I'm sharing freely.
You are free to improve it yourself if you want.
